### Summary of the project

Nowadays, we are experiencing a revolution in astronomical surveys. Thanks to ground-based and orbiting telescopes, millions of observations of asteroids in various photometric filters are available. One way to take full advantage of the vast amount of data from different telescopes is to merge the databases that each one generates. The main challenge in combining these data sets involves processing information with distinct properties (for example, different random and systematic errors, some non-Gaussian, different filters, or observation conditions).
The main objective of our project is to develop tools for reading, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. The initial step of our work involved creating a homogeneous massive photometric database containing observations from different surveys: SDSS, Gaia, TESS, SkyMapper, and ATLAS. We supplemented the original catalogs with additional information such as phase angles, ecliptic coordinates, computed fluxes, etc. The database currently contains around 70 million observations of over 500,000 asteroids. The codes used for database creation are generic enough to be easily reused as new databases emerge.

2024/03/29: In this repository you can find Python code for generating homogeneous database. At this point, we have downloaded data from ATLAS, Gaia, SDSS, SkyMapper and TESS.
